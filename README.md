- git clone https://github.com/Mayuresh306/Blockchain-CrowdFunding-Nullclass-Internship.git
- cd Blockchain-CrowdFunding-Nullclass-Internship

2. Install dependencies:
- npm install

3. Create a .env file in the root directory:
- cp .env.example .env
- Fill in your own credentials inside .env:
- PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
- ALCHEMY_API_KEY=your_alchemy_api_key_here

4. Run tests or scripts:
- npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia

🛡 Bonus: Use dotenv in your scripts securely
Your Hardhat config file should use:

require("dotenv").config();

module.exports = {
  networks: {
    sepolia: {
      url: `https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/${process.env.ALCHEMY_API_KEY}`,
